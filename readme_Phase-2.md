# Data Science Internship - Phase 2 Project

Welcome to the Phase 2 project of my Data Science internship at Shiney! This project is focused on comprehensive data exploration and analysis of a diverse dataset. Below, I provide an overview of the project, its objectives, and key findings.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To conduct in-depth data exploration, analyze data, and visualize insights.
- **Dataset**: [https://github.com/ine-rmotr-curriculum/FreeCodeCamp-Pandas-Real-Life-Example/blob/master/data/sales_data.csv]
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Structure

- `code.py`: The Python script containing all the code for data exploration and visualization.
- `data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `output/`: Directory containing output visualizations and summary statistics.

## Key Tasks

### 1. Initial Overview

- **Dataset Shape**: The dataset consists of [Insert Number of Rows] rows and [Insert Number of Columns] columns.
- **First Few Rows**: Displayed the first 5 rows of the dataset for initial inspection.

### 2. Data Types

- **Column Data Types**: Identified the data types of each column (e.g., numerical, categorical).

### 3. Summary Statistics

- **Numerical Columns**: Calculated summary statistics for numerical columns, including mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles.

### 4. Unique Values in Categorical Columns

- Listed unique values for selected categorical columns such as Product Category, Sub-Category, Age Group, and Customer Gender.

### 5. Visualize Sales by Product Category (Optional)

- Created a bar plot to visualize sales trends by product category, providing insights into revenue patterns.

### 6. Correlation Matrix and Heatmap

- Calculated correlations between numerical columns and visualized them using a heatmap.

### 7. Histograms for Numerical Columns

- Created histograms for each numerical column, allowing for a better understanding of data distributions.

## Conclusion

This project has been a valuable learning experience, enhancing my data analysis and visualization skills. I've gained insights into the dataset's characteristics and its potential impact on decision-making.

I'm excited to share this project with the community and welcome any feedback or discussions about data science and analysis.
