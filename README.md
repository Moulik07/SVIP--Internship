# Stock Data Analysis 

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to the Data Analysis Task, a component of my internship at Shineway in the role of Data Science Intern. To achieve this goal, I selected a hypothetical dataset obtained from the internet. This task involves a comprehensive analysis of the historical stock data of Reliance Industries, one of India's largest multinational conglomerates. Our focus is on applying data cleaning, detailed statistical analysis, and visualizations to gain insights into the stock's historical performance.
Please Note: The outcomes depicted in the graphs solely reflect the dataset utilized.

## Repository Structure
- `RELIANCE.csv` - The raw dataset containing historical stock data of Reliance Industries.
- `StockDataAnalysis_SVIP.ipynb` - A Jupyter Notebook containing all data analysis, including code, visualizations, and insights.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Methodical handling of missing values and date-time conversions to ensure data integrity.
- **Comprehensive Statistical Analysis**: Detailed examination of key financial metrics such as opening, closing, high, low prices, and trading volume, including mean, median, and standard deviation calculations.
- **Diverse Data Visualizations**:
  - Trend analysis via Time-Series Plot of Closing Prices.
  - Distribution analysis using Histograms for Daily Price Changes.
  - Examination of Trading Volume trends using Yearly Average Volume Bar Plots.
  - Closing Prices Distribution through Box Plots.
  - Relationship analysis between Trading Volume and Closing Prices via Scatter Plots.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating a wide array of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## Installation and Execution
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install the necessary libraries using the following commands:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
Clone this repository to your local machine, navigate to the directory containing `stock_analysis.ipynb`, and open it using a Jupyter Notebook server to view and run the analysis.

## Insights and Observations
- The Time-Series Analysis uncovers the long-term trends and significant historical fluctuations in the stock price.
- The Histogram of Daily Price Changes provides insights into the daily volatility and stability of the stock.
- The Scatter Plot between Trading Volume and Closing Prices reveals potential correlations and market behavior patterns, highlighting how trading activity might influence stock prices.
